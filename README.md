Black Jack Implementation

In this simulation, I have followed the rules laid out by the editors at 
Pagat.com (From Introduction to Payouts, https://www.pagat.com/banking/blackjack.html)
I have plotted the flow chart to describe the high-level logic of one round of Black Jack in Figure 1. In this graph, the color filled (coral, grey and blue) boxes are final outcome of a game. Once we know the outcome, a payout utility is initiated to calculate the payout amount to the player.
